# Portfolio website creation
## - HTM/CSS course project
Development of a portfolio web site implementing HMTL and CSS only as per course requirements.
The project will consider mobile first

The aim of this project is to learn and practice HTML and CSS skills by building a web site that will serve me as a portfolio in the future.
I was able to put into practice use of: 
- animations
- gris
- flex box
- transitions
- use of semantic HTML
- Consider responsiveness in the design

It was and still is challenging to figure out the correct properties to be use and to get the css to do exactly what is desired but in time I will master it. ;-)
